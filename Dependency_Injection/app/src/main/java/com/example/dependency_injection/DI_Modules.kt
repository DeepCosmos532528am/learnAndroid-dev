/**‚úÖ Why two different versions of Chassis but same type!
You created two different versions of the same type (Chassis), and used custom tags (@Dev and @Test) to tell Hilt which one is which.

Then you told Hilt how to build a Car (which needs a Model, which needs a Chassis).

üîç Why We Did This (Significance)
When you have multiple objects of the same type, Hilt won‚Äôt know which one to inject unless you give it a clue.
That clue is called a @Qualifier (in your case, @Dev and @Test).

Without qualifiers, Hilt would throw an error:

"Multiple bindings for type Chassis, but no way to choose between them."

üí° Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're a car factory.
You can make two types of Chassis:

A normal Dev Chassis for internal testing.

A Test Chassis for crash tests.

But when someone in your factory asks for a Chassis, how do you know which one they want?

You solve this by putting labels (like @Dev or @Test) on each and asking them to specify the label when requesting.

üöÄ Real-World Popular Example
In companies like Netflix, Amazon, or Google, they often:

Use fake APIs or mock data (Test) in testing environments.

Use real APIs (Dev or Prod) when testing features internally or running in production.

So they create different versions of the same dependency, just like you're doing with Chassis, and switch between them using qualifiers.*/
